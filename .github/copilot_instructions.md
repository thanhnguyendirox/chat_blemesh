This repository uses GitHub Copilot. Please follow these guidelines when using Copilot in this project:

- Prefer concise, well-documented code.
- Avoid generating duplicate or unnecessary code.
- Use comments to indicate unchanged regions when suggesting edits.
- Ensure all code follows the repository's style and conventions.
- Do not generate code that violates copyright or licensing terms.
- For new files, adding comments of author by github account email and date modified, place them inside the appropriate project directory.
- For modifications, use line comments to represent unchanged code as `// ...existing code... `.
- Avoid generating the function or class signature if it already exists; only generate the body.
- Avoid generating or suggesting the functions or API calls that are not already present in java, kotlin libraries.
- when generating/suggesting code, ensure it is relevant to the context of the existing code, function name must exist in files code or in frameworks and libraries.
- when answering questions about the codebase, or code files, ensure adding fraction of the code under the demonstration of that fraction code, to provide context.
- when generating the documentation for the code, ensure adding function name/classname of the code under the demonstration of a function, to provide context and should document following the step by step of app/architecture and deep into each business function.
